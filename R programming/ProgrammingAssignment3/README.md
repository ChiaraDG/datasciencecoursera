### Programming Assignment 2: Hospital Quality

The dataset used for this assignment is:

- [outcome-of-care.csv](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/R%20programming/ProgrammingAssignment3/outcome-of-care-measures.csv)

The functions (written in R) are in [ProgrammingAssignment3](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/R%20programming/ProgrammingAssignment3/ProgrammingAssignment3.R). The document contains the following functions:

- best: best hospital within a State for a user-defined outcome

- rankhospital: ranks the hospitals (for a user-specified State and outcome) in ascending order based on the lower 30-day mortality rate.

- rankall: output the hospitals (one for each state) with a user-specified ranking.

An example of the aformentioned three functions can be found in:

- [Hospital_Quality.md](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/R%20programming/ProgrammingAssignment3/Hospital_Quality.md)

- [Hospital_Quality.Rmd](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/R%20programming/ProgrammingAssignment3/Hospital%20Quality.Rmd)

- [Model.R](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/Capstone%20Project/Model.R): model used to generate next word prediction.

The shiny app can be found [here](https://chiaradg.shinyapps.io/NextWordPredictor/), while the folder [NextWordPredictor](https://github.com/ChiaraDG/datasciencecoursera/tree/master/Capstone%20Project/NextWordPredictor) contains the code used to generate the Shiny app. A slide deck summarising the app is published in rpubs (http://rpubs.com/chiaradg/236363).
